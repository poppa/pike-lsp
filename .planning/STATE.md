## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

No decisions yet for v2. Decisions will be logged as plans execute.

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 01-01):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 01-01-D01 | Use native Error.cause via { cause } option | Node.js 16.9.0+ support, cleaner than manual property assignment |
| 01-01-D02 | Conditional cause assignment for exactOptionalPropertyTypes | Avoids TypeScript strict mode error when assigning undefined |

**Design Decisions (from v2 design document):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| V2-D01 | TypeScript error chains, Pike flat dicts | Pike lacks stack context - pretending otherwise creates leaky abstractions |
| V2-D02 | Group handlers by capability (4 files) not by verb (11 files) | Reduces cognitive load by keeping related logic collocated |
| V2-D03 | Pre-push hooks, not pre-commit | Maintains defense in depth without strangling minute-by-minute workflow |
| V2-D04 | Pike uses werror(), TypeScript wraps in Logger | Achieves unified log stream without over-engineering Pike logging library |
| V2-D05 | 3-4 Pike files per .pmod, not 8 | Avoids micro-modules that hurt grep-ability |

### Roadmap Evolution

**2026-01-20**: v2 milestone initialized
- Source: Design Document v2 (Middle Ground)
- Previous milestone: v1 Pike Refactoring (archived)
- Approach: Infrastructure-First with Pragmatic Implementation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From design document:**
- Phase 3 (Bridge Extraction) is critical - the stdin bug would be caught here
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 1 (errors.ts, logging.ts) and Phase 3 (refactored bridge)
- Phase 5 should wait until server-side is stable

**Current (as of plan 01-01):**
- No blockers - error classes ready for use in logging module
