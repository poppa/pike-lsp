### Decisions

**Implementation Decisions (from plans 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 03-01, 03-02, 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-04, 04-05, 04-06):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 01-01-D01 | Use native Error.cause via { cause } option | Node.js 16.9.0+ support, cleaner than manual property assignment |
| 01-01-D02 | Conditional cause assignment for exactOptionalPropertyTypes | Avoids TypeScript strict mode error when assigning undefined |
| 01-02-D01 | All logs to console.error (stderr) | LSP servers emit diagnostics to stderr, not stdout |
| 01-02-D02 | Numeric log levels for comparison | Enables efficient level-based filtering without string comparisons |
| 01-02-D03 | No transports/formatters in Logger | Keep logging minimal per lean observability principle |
| 01-03-D01 | Duplicated errors.ts and logging.ts in pike-bridge | Avoid circular dependency (bridge <-> server). TODO: Extract to shared @pike-lsp/core |
| 01-03-D02 | Pike returns flat dicts, TypeScript adds layer tracking | Pike lacks stack context. make_error() returns {error, kind, msg, line} |
| 02-01-D01 | Pre-push hook only, not pre-commit | "Green main, not green commits" philosophy - allow broken intermediate commits |
| 02-01-D02 | Conditional smoke test validation | Hook works before smoke tests exist (plan 02-02 pending) |
| 02-02-D01 | Smoke tests verify structure not content | Tests stay stable as implementation changes, focus on "does it crash" not "exact output" |
| 02-02-D02 | Single bridge instance reused across tests | Faster than start/stop per test, 30 second timeout accommodates slow PikeBridge startup |
| 02-03-D01 | Pike 8.0 from apt for main CI test job | Reliable, matches production environment |
| 02-03-D02 | Smoke tests run after unit tests in CI | Fast feedback loop, keeps related tests grouped |
| 02-03-D03 | VSCode E2E job waits for unit tests | Job dependency via needs: [test, pike-test] ensures E2E only runs if unit tests pass |
| 02-03-D04 | xvfb-run wraps VSCode E2E tests | Provides X11 display for headless Linux CI environment |
| 03-01-D01 | readline.createInterface() for stdout reading | Prevents JSON fragmentation and stdin bug by reading complete lines |
| 03-01-D02 | PikeProcess is pure IPC wrapper, no business logic | Separation: PikeProcess handles spawn/readline/events, PikeBridge handles correlation/timeouts/deduplication |
| 03-02-D01 | MockPikeProcess class enables isolated unit testing | Tests can run without Pike installation by simulating process behavior |
| 03-02-D02 | PikeBridge delegates all IPC to PikeProcess | Clean separation: PikeProcess handles spawn/readline/events, PikeBridge handles correlation/timeouts/deduplication |
| 04-01-D01 | Used type imports to avoid circular dependencies | import type prevents circular deps between services and core |
| 04-01-D02 | DocumentCacheEntry type centralizes document state | Used by both cache and consumers, single source of truth |
| 04-01-D03 | BridgeManager wraps PikeBridge via composition | Composition over inheritance for cleaner separation of concerns |
| 04-02-D01 | Navigation handlers receive Services bundle + TextDocuments | Clean dependency injection without accessing global documents |
| 04-02-D02 | Helper functions kept in navigation.ts module | Module cohesion - related functions co-located with their handlers |
| 04-02-D03 | Used Array.from() for DocumentCache.entries() iteration | Avoids downlevelIteration compilation issues with ES5 target |
| 04-03-D01 | TextDocuments passed as parameter not in Services | TextDocuments is LSP protocol managed, keeps Services focused on server state |
| 04-03-D02 | Helper functions kept in editing.ts module | Functions like buildCompletionItem are feature-specific, no sharing required |
| 04-03-D03 | Direct logger usage without child() method | Logger class doesn't have child() method, using logger.debug/info directly |
| 04-04-D01 | Use new Logger() instead of logger.child() | Logger class doesn't have child method, create new instance per feature |
| 04-04-D02 | Import SymbolKind as value not type | Needed for enum member access in switch statement |
| 04-04-D03 | Add analyzeUninitialized to BridgeManager | Exposes PikeBridge method for diagnostics feature handlers |
| 04-05-D01 | Made BridgeManager.bridge public readonly for feature handler access | Avoids getter methods while maintaining encapsulation |
| 04-05-D02 | Used Array.from() for DocumentCache iteration | DocumentCache is a Map subclass, needs explicit conversion for for/of loops |
| 04-05-D03 | Added globalSettings and includePaths to Services interface | Advanced handlers need mutable access to config |
| 04-05-D04 | Extracted defaultSettings to core/types.ts | Removes duplication with server.ts, provides single source of truth |
| 04-06-D01 | Use connection.workspace.onExecuteCommand for workspace commands | Workspace commands require workspace-level handler, not connection-level |
| 04-06-D02 | Register command after client.start() in extension.ts | Ensures LanguageClient is available when command is invoked |
| 04-06-D03 | Use dot notation (pike.lsp.showDiagnostics) consistently | Standard VSCode command format, must match across server.ts, extension.ts, package.json |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-01):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-01-D01 | Use module.submodule.class pattern for accessing classes in nested .pmod directories | Pike creates submodules for .pike files inside .pmod directories; constant export creates circular dependency |
| 05-01-D02 | Keep shared helper functions in module.pmod, classes in separate .pike files | Pike's .pmod system merges module.pmod contents directly into module namespace |
| 05-01-D03 | Use master()->resolv() for module resolution instead of constant exports | Avoids circular dependency at compile time; runtime resolution works correctly |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-02):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-02-D01 | Resolution class uses sibling Introspection for program introspection | Introspection class already has introspect_program implementation; use master()->resolv("LSP.Intelligence.Introspection.Introspection") to access |
| 05-02-D02 | TypeAnalysis.parse_autodoc called by Resolution.parse_stdlib_documentation | AutoDoc parsing logic belongs in TypeAnalysis class; Resolution delegates for separation of concerns |
| 05-02-D03 | Both classes access module.pmod helpers via master()->resolv | Pike's module system requires runtime resolution; functionp() check ensures function exists |
| 05-02-D04 | BOOTSTRAP_MODULES constant guards against circular dependency | Modules used by the resolver (Stdio, String, Array, Mapping) return early during resolution to avoid timeout |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-03):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-03-D01 | Use module.pmod for shared helpers in .pmod subdirectories | Pike's .pmod pattern allows module.pmod to export functions directly to the namespace |
| 05-03-D02 | Access module.pmod functions via master()->resolv() in classes | Classes within the .pmod need a reference to module.pmod to access functions; use program module_program = master()->resolv("LSP.Analysis.module") |
| 05-03-D03 | File and class with same name (Diagnostics.pike contains class Diagnostics) | Standard Pike pattern where file name matches primary class name; access via master()->resolv("LSP.Analysis.Diagnostics")->Diagnostics |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-04):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-04-D01 | Completions.pike contains handle_get_completion_context with token-based context analysis | Token-based analysis is more accurate than regex for determining completion context; scans backward from cursor to find access operators (->, ., ::) |
| 05-04-D02 | Variables.pike contains handle_find_occurrences per v2 design (Occurrences not separate file) | Finding occurrences is fundamentally about tracking variable references; keeping Occurrences in Variables.pike maintains grep-ability and reduces micro-modules |
| 05-04-D03 | Both classes use create(object ctx) constructor pattern matching Diagnostics class | Consistent pattern across all Analysis.pmod classes; context reserved for future use with LSP context |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-05):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-05-D01 | Updated analyzer.pike to use master()->resolv("LSP.Intelligence.Intelligence") pattern | With .pmod directories, resolv returns module not class; full qualified path required |
| 05-05-D02 | Placed delegating classes in module.pmod files within .pmod directories | module.pmod contents merged into module namespace, making classes accessible as LSP.Module.ClassName |
| 05-05-D03 | Removed original Intelligence.pike and Analysis.pike files | .pmod directories take precedence; remove redundant files to avoid confusion |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 05-06):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 05-06-D01 | Tests access delegating classes via module.pmod submodule (LSP.Intelligence.module.Intelligence) | .pmod directories merge module.pmod contents; class defined within that file |
| 05-06-D02 | Parser.pike is a class module (file itself is the class) | Use programp(module) not module->Parser for single-file Pike modules |
| 05-06-D03 | Module directory structure validated via indices() function | .pmod directories are special Pike module type, not traditional mappings |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 06-01):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 06-01-D01 | Use existing test.pike in test-workspace instead of creating dynamic files | Avoids URI scheme issues that prevent LSP from caching the document |
| 06-01-D02 | Test file uses 30-60 second timeout to allow LSP server initialization | LSP server needs time to start Pike subprocess and analyze files |
| 06-01-D03 | Tests use vscode.executeXProvider pattern for true E2E verification | No mocking - tests verify actual VSCode API returns valid data |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 06-02):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 06-02-D01 | Added explicit LSP feature test step to CI (runs after general E2E) | Makes feature tests visible in CI logs; test:features filter shows only feature tests |
| 06-02-D02 | Pre-push hook uses test:features script | Faster than full test suite; catches LSP regressions before push |
| 06-02-D03 | Debugging guide organized by symptom | Developers see failure message first; symptom-based lookup is faster |
| 06-02-D04 | Updated CI badge URL to correct repository | Badge pointed to andjo/pike-lsp; current repo is smuks/OpenCode/pike-lsp |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 07-01):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 07-01-D01 | Disabled stdlib preloading instead of fixing introspection | Bootstrap modules (Stdio, String, Array, Mapping) crash Pike when introspected. Fixing requires deep changes to module loading. |
| 07-01-D02 | Made Services.bridge nullable with dynamic access | Bridge initializes after handler registration. Destructuring captures null reference. Access dynamically in handlers. |
| 07-01-D03 | Used negative cache for bootstrap modules | Prevents future attempts to introspect modules known to crash Pike subprocess |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 08-01):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 08-01-D01 | Use .js extensions in barrel exports for ESM compatibility | TypeScript requires explicit extensions for ES modules |
| 08-01-D02 | dist/ directory gitignored in @pike-lsp/core | Build artifacts are generated, not source code |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 08-02):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 08-02-D01 | Keep re-exports in pike-bridge/index.ts for consumer convenience | Consumers can import from either package; pike-bridge maintains its public API |

**Implementation Decisions (from plan 08-03):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 08-03-D01 | Keep PikeSettings and DocumentCacheEntry in pike-lsp-server | These types have dependencies on server-specific constants and PikeSymbol type from @pike-lsp/pike-bridge |
| 08-03-D02 | Re-export pattern in core/index.ts | The pike-lsp-server/core/index.ts re-exports from @pike-lsp/core while also exporting server-specific types |

**Design Decisions (from v2 design document):**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| V2-D01 | TypeScript error chains, Pike flat dicts | Pike lacks stack context - pretending otherwise creates leaky abstractions |
| V2-D02 | Group handlers by capability (4 files) not by verb (11 files) | Reduces cognitive load by keeping related logic collocated |
| V2-D03 | Pre-push hooks, not pre-commit | Maintains defense in depth without strangling minute-by-minute workflow |
| V2-D04 | Pike uses werror(), TypeScript wraps in Logger | Achieves unified log stream without over-engineering Pike logging library |
| V2-D05 | 3-4 Pike files per .pmod, not 8 | Avoids micro-modules that hurt grep-ability |

### Roadmap Evolution

**2026-01-20**: v2 milestone initialized
- Source: Design Document v2 (Middle Ground)
- Previous milestone: v1 Pike Refactoring (archived)
- Approach: Infrastructure-First with Pragmatic Implementation

**2026-01-21**: v2 milestone nearly complete
- All 31 plans across 8 phases finished
- E2E feature tests created and integrated into CI
- Bridge initialization timing fixed
- Stdlib preloading disabled to avoid crashes
- Automated verification prevents LSP regressions
- 7/7 E2E feature tests passing (100%)
- Phase 8 complete: ~512 lines of duplicate code eliminated via @pike-lsp/core shared package

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From design document:**
- Phase 3 (Bridge Extraction) is critical - the stdin bug would be caught here
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 1 (errors.ts, logging.ts) and Phase 3 (refactored bridge)
- Phase 5 should wait until server-side is stable

**Current (as of plan 07-01):**
- **No blockers.** Plan 07-01 completed with deviations:
  - Root cause was different from plan assumption (bridge initialization timing, not duplicate handlers)
  - Fixed bridge initialization timing by making Services.bridge nullable
  - Disabled stdlib preloading to avoid Pike subprocess crashes on bootstrap modules
  - E2E tests improved from 7/12 to 9/12 passing
  - Remaining 3 failures are test fixture issues, not LSP server problems

**See:** `.planning/phases/07-fix-document-lifecycle-handler-duplication/07-01-SUMMARY.md` for details

**TODOs from previous phases:**
- ~~TODO: Consider extracting errors.ts and logging.ts to shared @pike-lsp/core package to eliminate duplication~~ (COMPLETED in 08-01)
- ~~TODO: Update pike-bridge to import from @pike-lsp/core~~ (COMPLETED in 08-02)
- ~~TODO: Update pike-lsp-server to import from @pike-lsp/core~~ (COMPLETED in 08-03)
- TODO: Consider moving helper functions (flattenSymbols, buildSymbolPositionIndex) to utility modules
- TODO: Pike version detection in BridgeManager.getHealth() - returns null for now (documented limitation)
- TODO: Investigate alternative approach for safe stdlib preloading (07-01-D01) - bootstrap modules crash Pike when introspected
