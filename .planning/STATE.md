# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Safety without rigidity - solve actual pain points without over-engineering
**Current focus:** v3.0 Performance Optimization - Phase 12 (Request Consolidation)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 17 (Request Consolidation)
Plan: 3 of 5 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 — Completed 12-03: Handler wrapper migration

Progress: [██████████-----------] 52%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14
- Average duration: ~11m 26s
- Total execution time: 2.66 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 10    | 3     | 3     | 8m 30s   |
| 11    | 5     | 5     | 5m 36s   |
| 12    | 3     | 3     | 29m      |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 11-05, 12-01, 12-02, 12-03
- Trend: Phase 12 progressing - Handler wrappers added

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (v3 init): Benchmark first, optimize second - establish baseline before changes
- (v3 init): In-memory caching only - no disk persistence in v3
- (10-01): Use high-resolution System.Timer() for microsecond accuracy in Pike responses.
- (10-01): Inject _perf metadata into JSON-RPC responses to separate logic from overhead.
- (10-02): Propagate _perf metadata through PikeBridge to enable E2E vs Internal breakdown.
- (10-03): Performance regression gate set at 20% threshold in CI.
- (11-01): Instrument before optimizing - startup timing baseline established. Context initialization (~18ms) dominates Pike startup, indicating primary optimization target.
- (11-02): Defer Context creation to first request - reduces Pike subprocess startup time from ~18ms to ~0.05ms (99.7% faster). First request pays Context creation cost (~18ms).
- (11-03): Use __REAL_VERSION__ builtin constant for version logging - eliminates LSP.Compat module load at startup (~10-30ms saved). get_version RPC handler loads Compat on-demand.
- (11-04): Async version fetch in BridgeManager - fire-and-forget pattern reduces perceived startup time by 100-200ms.
- (11-05): <500ms startup goal achieved - 203ms TypeScript cold start, 0.05ms Pike subprocess ready time. All optimizations validated via benchmarks and E2E tests.
- (12-01): Unified analyze handler implemented - handle_analyze() consolidates compilation, tokenization, and analysis into single request. Supports partial success with result/failures structure. Performance timing via _perf.compilation_ms and _perf.tokenization_ms.
- (12-02): TypeScript analyze client integration - AnalyzeRequest/AnalyzeResponse types, PikeBridge.analyze() method, BridgeManager.analyze() pass-through. O(1) failure lookup pattern with failures?.[operation] direct access.
- (12-03): Handler wrapper migration - parse, introspect, analyze_uninitialized now delegate to analyze() with deprecation warnings. Backward-compatible response format maintained via result extraction. Fallback to original handlers if analyze() returns empty.

### Performance Investigation Findings (2026-01-22)

Key bottlenecks identified:
1. **Triple compilation** - introspect(), parse(), analyzeUninitialized() all re-compile same code
2. **Stdlib preloading disabled** - "Parent lost, cannot clone program" errors force lazy loading
3. **Symbol position indexing** - IPC call + regex fallback per validation
4. **Cold start** - Pike subprocess initialization ~200ms (measured in 10-01)
5. **Sequential workspace indexing** - not parallelized

**RESOLVED from 11-02:**
- Context initialization moved from startup to first request
- Pike "ready" time: ~0.05ms (was ~18ms)
- First request triggers Context creation: ~18ms
- Subsequent requests use cached Context (no additional cost)

**from 11-01:**
- Pike startup breakdown: path_setup (~0.07ms), version (~0.5ms), handlers (~0.5ms), **context (~18ms)**, total (~19ms)
- Context initialization (Parser, Intelligence, Analysis modules) accounts for ~99% of Pike startup time
- TypeScript bridge start ~200ms (subprocess spawn overhead)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 12-03 complete, ready for 12-04 (Feature handler migration) or 12-05 (Cleanup and documentation).
