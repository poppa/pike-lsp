# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Safety without rigidity - solve actual pain points without over-engineering
**Current focus:** v3.0 Performance Optimization - Phase 15 (Cross-File Caching)

## Current Position

Phase: 15 of 17 (Cross-File Caching)
Plan: 1 of 1
Status: Planning complete, ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-01-23 — Completed 14-01: Request Logging Analysis

Progress: [█████████████████░░░░░] 65%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 28
- Average duration: ~12m 31s
- Total execution time: 5.85 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Complete | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| 10    | 3     | 3        | 8m 30s   |
| 11    | 5     | 5        | 5m 36s   |
| 12    | 5     | 5        | 27m      |
| 13    | 4     | 4        | 6m 50s   |
| 14    | 1*    | 1        | ~15m     |

*Phase 14: 1 of 2 plans executed; 14-02 skipped as unnecessary

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 13-01, 13-02, 13-03, 13-04, 14-01
- Trend: Phase 14 complete - Logging confirmed no duplicate analyze() calls; existing deduping sufficient

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (v3 init): Benchmark first, optimize second - establish baseline before changes
- (v3 init): In-memory caching only - no disk persistence in v3
- (10-01): Use high-resolution System.Timer() for microsecond accuracy in Pike responses.
- (10-01): Inject _perf metadata into JSON-RPC responses to separate logic from overhead.
- (10-02): Propagate _perf metadata through PikeBridge to enable E2E vs Internal breakdown.
- (10-03): Performance regression gate set at 20% threshold in CI.
- (11-01): Instrument before optimizing - startup timing baseline established. Context initialization (~18ms) dominates Pike startup, indicating primary optimization target.
- (11-02): Defer Context creation to first request - reduces Pike subprocess startup time from ~18ms to ~0.05ms (99.7% faster). First request pays Context creation cost (~18ms).
- (11-03): Use __REAL_VERSION__ builtin constant for version logging - eliminates LSP.Compat module load at startup (~10-30ms saved). get_version RPC handler loads Compat on-demand.
- (11-04): Async version fetch in BridgeManager - fire-and-forget pattern reduces perceived startup time by 100-200ms.
- (11-05): <500ms startup goal achieved - 203ms TypeScript cold start, 0.05ms Pike subprocess ready time. All optimizations validated via benchmarks and E2E tests.
- (12-01): Unified analyze handler implemented - handle_analyze() consolidates compilation, tokenization, and analysis into single request. Supports partial success with result/failures structure. Performance timing via _perf.compilation_ms and _perf.tokenization_ms.
- (12-02): TypeScript analyze client integration - AnalyzeRequest/AnalyzeResponse types, PikeBridge.analyze() method, BridgeManager.analyze() pass-through. O(1) failure lookup pattern with failures?.[operation] direct access.
- (12-03): Handler wrapper migration - parse, introspect, analyze_uninitialized now delegate to analyze() with deprecation warnings. Backward-compatible response format maintained via result extraction. Fallback to original handlers if analyze() returns empty.
- (12-04): Validation pipeline consolidation - validateDocument() uses single analyze() call instead of 3 separate calls (introspect, parse, analyzeUninitialized). ~66% reduction in IPC overhead per document validation. Partial failure handling with fallback defaults ensures robustness.
- (12-05): Benchmark verification - Request Consolidation suite shows ~11% latency reduction (1.85ms → 1.64ms) from 3-call to 1-call validation. CI regression gate at 20% threshold protects performance.
- (13-01): CompilationCache module created - Nested mapping cache (path -> version -> CompilationResult) with dual-path key generation (LSP version for open docs, mtime:size for closed files). O(1) file invalidation, nuclear eviction at 500 file limit, statistics tracking (hits/misses/evictions).
- (13-02): Dependency tracking implemented - Bidirectional dependency graph (forward edges: dependencies[path], reverse edges: dependents[dep]), BFS transitive invalidation, local file filtering excludes stdlib, DependencyTrackingCompiler captures inherit/import via line-based parsing.
- (13-03): Cache integration complete - handle_analyze checks cache before compiling, Context includes CompilationCache instance, bridge.analyze() accepts documentVersion parameter, diagnostics passes document version for open doc caching. Cache metadata (cache_hit, cache_key) exposed in _perf for debugging.
- (13-04): Cache benchmark validation - Compilation Cache benchmark group added, demonstrates 61% speedup (cache hit: 313us, cache miss: 805us). CI regression gate enforces 80% hit rate and 50% speedup thresholds. get_cache_stats RPC handler returns cache statistics.
- (14-01): TypeScript-side deduping NOT needed - Logging confirmed no duplicate analyze() calls occur. Debounce (500ms) correctly coalesces rapid edits. PikeBridge inflight deduping handles edge cases. RequestDeduper implementation skipped to avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Performance Investigation Findings (2026-01-22)

Key bottlenecks identified:
1. **Triple compilation** - introspect(), parse(), analyzeUninitialized() all re-compile same code
2. **Stdlib preloading disabled** - "Parent lost, cannot clone program" errors force lazy loading
3. **Symbol position indexing** - IPC call + regex fallback per validation
4. **Cold start** - Pike subprocess initialization ~200ms (measured in 10-01)
5. **Sequential workspace indexing** - not parallelized

**RESOLVED from 11-02:**
- Context initialization moved from startup to first request
- Pike "ready" time: ~0.05ms (was ~18ms)
- First request triggers Context creation: ~18ms
- Subsequent requests use cached Context (no additional cost)

**from 11-01:**
- Pike startup breakdown: path_setup (~0.07ms), version (~0.5ms), handlers (~0.5ms), **context (~18ms)**, total (~19ms)
- Context initialization (Parser, Intelligence, Analysis modules) accounts for ~99% of Pike startup time
- TypeScript bridge start ~200ms (subprocess spawn overhead)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 14 complete - Logging confirmed existing deduping is sufficient; no TypeScript-side deduping needed.
